## Error Pages

The static error pages for HAProxy are added from the `error_pages/html` directory. These are generated using the Ruby script in `error_pages` and the
error definitions in `error_pages/errors.yml`. The script has no dependencies apart from the Ruby standard library which should always be just available.

You can re-build the static error pages by running `ruby error_pages/build.rb` and committing the result if you have ruby installed on your system.
