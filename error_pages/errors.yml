  title: Bad Request
  description: 
    |
      The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived
      to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing,
      or deceptive request routing).

403:
  title: Forbidden
  description: 
    |
      The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

      prepared to wait.

    |
      The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the
      request.
502:
  title: Bad Gateway

      inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request.
503:
  title: Service Unavailable
  description:

      The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or
      scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.

  title: Gateway Timeout
  description: 
    |
      The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from
